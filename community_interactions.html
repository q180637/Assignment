                        Bungie have many social media accounts that they use in order to commune with their communities about Destiny 2. Two of which are on Twiiter and operate under the handles @BungieHelp and @DestinyTheGame. @BungieHelp is used to detail when there are updates and server maintenance as well as when an issue has been identified while @DestinyTheGame is typically used to keep up community engagement by alerting people to the weekly TWAB and other news articles such as content release reveals. These two accounts can be seen on this page (left and right on desktop, above and below on mobile). These are not the only accounts they use however as they also have a number of Community Managers which will frequently report back to the community on internal matters such as when bugs have been heard of. Community Managers will also frequently ask for feedback from the community and the report it back to the appropriate internal teams.<br><br> Alongside the multitude of social media accounts, Bungie also post a weekly news update about the game called TWABs. TWAB stands for This Week At Bungie and is a news article release that talks a lot about internal affairs at Bungie such as if new content has been announced and upcoming charity events. The TWAB also contains a weekly competition known as Movie of the Week(MOTW). The MOTW competition gives players the option to create fan art or videos about the game or using the game in an attempt to gain an in game cosmetic known as an emblem.

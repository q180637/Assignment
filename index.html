                    At its core Destiny 2 is a game centred around defeating opponents and overcoming challenges to earn gear to upgrade the player's character. Player characters can have one of three main classes each of which have their own unique subclassess and abilities. The three main classes are Titan, Hunter and Warlock. Their abilities are all classified by the element they use being either: Arc; Solar; Void, and since Destiny 2: Beyond Light, Stasis. Alongside these abilities is an arsenal of 3 weapon classes which will aid in the fight against the Minions of the Darkness. The three weapon class are Kinetic, Energy and Heavy. When paired with the powerful abilities that each class has to offer none of the enemy races will be able to withstand the player's power. Destiny 2 contains 7 enemy races: The Fallen, The Hive, The Vex, The Cabal, The Taken and The Scorn. Evey enemy race has their own set of enemy types with differing ranges and strengths. In order to take on these enemy races players can group up into teams of up to 3 for most average level content and up to 6 for most high tier content. Solo play is also an option though the game becomes much harder in most activities when played alone. Alongside the PvE (player versus environment) gameplay there is also a host of PvP (player versus player) activities which players can partake in should they choose to. All activities in the game feed off of one another as gear earned in an activity can be taken into any other activity. Similarly, players can take on extra objectives for each activity within the game in the form of "bounties" in order to earn extra experience points and gear.

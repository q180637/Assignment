                            The gameplay of Destiny 2 is centred around the actions of the player character referred to as simply The Guardian. These actions are often the result of the many abilities and weapons at a player's disposal which are all detailed under the Guardian section of the Grimoire (the lore cards that explain much of the worlds in Destiny). Grimoire cards that explain The Guardian's arsenal can be found <a href="https://www.destinypedia.com/Grimoire:Guardian">here</a>.

                            Whilst playing Destiny 2 a player will find themselves interacting with a number of non playable characters that aid them in their fight against The Darkness. Many of these allies preside in The Tower (the main social space and hub from which all gameplay stems) with a small number of them being discoverable in the world whilst playing. It is rare to see these allies interact with the actual gameplay directly although there have been a few instances of this occurring such as <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/hunter-vanguard">the Hunter Vanguard Cayde-6</a> during the opening mission of the Forsaken campaign as well as <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/warlock-vanguard">Vanguard for the Warlocks, Ikora Rey</a> in the Curse of Osiris storyline. Outside of these few circumstances their interactions are mostly limited to custscenes and issuing quests and gear.

                            As the basic principle of Destiny 2 is to fight The Darkness and its minions, Bungie have also produced a number of Lore entries on each enemy race. These enemy races are as follows <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/the-fallen">The Fallen</a>, <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/the-hive">The Hive</a>, <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/the-vex">The Vex</a>, <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/the-cabal">The Cabal</a>, <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/the-taken">The Taken</a> and The Scorn led by <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/entries/fikrul">The Fanatic</a>. Each of these enemy races can be broken down into multiple sects and enemy types. An example of a sect of one of these races would be the <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/precursors">Precursor Vex</a> while an example of one of some of the enemy types would be the Fallen <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/dreg">Dregs</a> and <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/captain">Captains</a>.

                            Destiny 2 has had a large roster of destinations that a player can visit in the fight against The Darkness since its launch in 2017. However, since the Beyond Light expansion of 2020 a number of these planets were removed in order to make space for new ones. The total list of planets that have had playable patrol spaces since launch is as folllows: Earth containing The European Dead Zone and <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/old-russia">The Cosmodrome</a> in Old Russia; <i>The New Pacific Arcology on Titan, Moon of Saturn</i>; The Arcadian Valley on Nessus, a planetoid in the outer system; <i>The Echo Mesa on IO, Moon of Jupiter</i>; <i>The Hellas Basin on Mars</i>; <i>The Caloris Basin on Mercury</i>; The Tangled Shore in The Reef near The Asteroid Belt of Mars; The Dreaming City (Location not verified); The Ocean of Storms on <a href="https://www.ishtar-collective.net/cards/moon">Earth's Moon</a>; and finally Rathmore Chaos on Europa, another of Jupiter's Moons. Each planet is home to multiple hostile races and has its own destination vendor. Note that planets in italics are the ones removed with the Beyond Light expansion. Just because a planet is no longer a playable patrol space does not mean it doesn't have consequences on current events as their are still plotlines pertaining to both the planets themselves and their absence.

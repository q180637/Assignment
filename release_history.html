                            Forsaken was the first major "Comet" expansion for Destiny 2 when it launched to all platforms on September 4th 2018. This release brought two new patrol zones: The Tangled Shore and The Dreaming City that housed its story campaign. This story campaign was then followed up by a lot of post-campaign content such as the Last Wish Raid a weekly rotating set of missions and a new level cap to reach. Forsaken's launch also brought with it a switch towards a seasonal model of content delivery that would continue end game progression and stories roughly every 3 months. After Forsaken there came 3 seasons: Season of the Forge; Season of the Drifter and Season of Opulence. This seasonal model would be refined over time as each yearly expansion released.

                            The second "Comet" expansion for Destiny 2, Shadowkeep, launched on October 1st 2019 bringing with it another story campaign, Raid and strikes all of which utilised the Moon patrol zone that had been revamped and brought back from Destiny 1. Shadowkeep's launch also marked the PC version of Destiny 2 moving to Steam, Destiny 2 going Free to Play and using an interconnected cross save system. After completing the story campaign of Shadowkeep players also had the option to purchase the Season of the Undying content which would mark the switch to an improved seasonal model that aimed to have a story which would carry between expansions drive the narrative forwards. Following Shadowkeep and Season of the Undying came the Season of Dawn, the Season of the Worthy and the Season of Arrivals which were used to progress the ongoing Darkness storyline leading into the Beyond Light expansion.

                            Beyond Light is the latest expansion to Destiny 2 which carried on the story laid out through seasons that followed Shadowkeep. Launching on the 10th of November 2020, a delayed launch date due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Beyond Light took players to Europa - a moon of Jupiter - from which they had access to a new story campaign and a small of number of Strikes as well as the new Deep Stone Crypt Raid. Beyond Light's launch also brought with it a reimagined onboarding experience for new players known as New Light to help teach them how the game works. Additionally, a new set of seasonal updates was started here beginning with Season of the Hunt and progressing into Season of the Chosen. This seasonal cycle is still evolving with the next chapter being available on the 11th May 2021 called Season of the Splicer.

                            When Bungie announced Beyond Light in June 2020 they also announced the name for the next two expansions. The first of these is The Witch Queen. All that is known about The Witch Queen is that players will be facing the Hive Goddess Savath√ªn, a character that has existed within the Lore for a long time but has never been seen in game. This expansion was initially slated for a fall 2021 launch however has since been pushed to spring 2022 due to development complications.
